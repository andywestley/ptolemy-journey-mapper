        <h2 class="mb-4">Why I Built This</h2>
        <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            If you've ever worked in UX, you know the drill: we spend days researching and building beautiful journey
            maps, only for them to get trapped inside a proprietary tool or a static image.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4" style="font-size: 1.1rem;">
            I built Ptolemy because I believe our work shouldn't be held hostage by a subscription. We need a way to
            collaborate, version-control our insights, and share our data freely.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3">The OpenJourney Format (.ojf)</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            At the heart of this project is a simple idea: an open, human-readable JSON format for user journeys.
            By using <strong>.ojf</strong>, your data stays in your hands. You can track changes with Git, build
            custom reports, or even move your data to a completely different tool without losing a single node.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-light p-4 rounded-3 border mb-5 shadow-sm">
            <h4 class="mb-3 h6 text-uppercase fw-bold text-muted">A look inside an .ojf file</h4>
            <pre class="mb-0" style="font-size: 0.9rem;"><code>{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "A Day in the Life",
    "version": "1.0"
  },
  "stages": [
    { "id": "s1", "name": "Discovery" }
  ],
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "n1",
      "stage": "s1",
      "title": "Found a better way",
      "description": "User realizes they don't need proprietary software."
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h3 class="mb-3">A Hobby Project with Heart</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Just to be clear: this isn't a venture-backed enterprise platform. It's a hobby project built by a UX
            professional who wanted a tool that didn't exist yet. It's built with <strong>PocketBase</strong> and
            plain old JavaScript, which makes it fast, privacy-focused, and easy to host yourself.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3">Human-Led, AI-Built</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            There’s one more thing you should know about how Ptolemy was made. While I provided the vision, the UX
            requirements, and the final design calls, I actually wrote very little of the source code by hand.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Instead, Ptolemy was built using **Google Antigravity**, an agentic AI coding assistant. We worked together
            in a high-intensity pair-programming process where I acted as the navigator and the AI acted as the
            primary builder. It allowed me to focus on the problem I wanted to solve, while the AI handled the
            heavy lifting of implementation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mb-3">Help Make it Better</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Since this is open-source, it belongs to the community as much as it does to me. If you have an idea for
            a new feature, find a bug, or just want to chat about the future of open journey standards, I'd love to
            hear from you.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-5">
            Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub. Let's make journey mapping better for
            everyone.

                for the complex landscape of human experiences.
